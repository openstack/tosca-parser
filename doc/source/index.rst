Welcome to heat-translator's documentation!
===========================================

The heat-translator tool is aimed to translate non-heat templates to OpenStack
Heat Orchestration Template (HOT). Initially the tool is aimed to translate
OASIS Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA)
to HOT. However, the tool can be easily extended to support any non-heat
template format to produce HOT.
